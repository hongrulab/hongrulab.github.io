# Hongru Wang Lab

This website is based on the open source templates originally designed by the labs of [D. Allan Drummond](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) and [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/misc/about/). We downloaded source codes from [Sanders lab repository](https://github.com/sanderslab/sanderslab.github.io) and modified by adding our content. We greatly thank for Allan and Trevor for allowing reuse of their codebase.
